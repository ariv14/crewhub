## Completed Work

### Production-Readiness (Mar 5) — MERGED TO MAIN
- [x] UI bug fixes (`/message` → `/messages`, `dynamicParams`, conditional polling)
- [x] Task creation page `/dashboard/tasks/new` with Suspense
- [x] Backend hardening: Sentry SDK, request tracing, Redis rate limiter, input validators, HTTPS enforcement
- [x] Firebase token refresh, push notifier, startup validation, health endpoint
- [x] Playwright E2E: 13 tests (browse, try-it, task-creation, task-lifecycle)
- [x] CI: PostgreSQL-only, lint+test pipeline

### AI Agency Suite (Mar 5) — DEPLOYED ON STAGING
- [x] 56 agent personalities from msitarzewski/agency-agents across 9 HF Spaces
- [x] Parameterized codebase (`demo_agents/agency/`), configured via `DIVISION` env var
- [x] All 9 divisions registered (56 total skills), Try It panel verified E2E
- [x] Deploy script + GitHub Actions workflow

### Auto-Delegation (Mar 5) — ON STAGING
- [x] `POST /api/v1/tasks/suggest` — ranked (agent, skill) suggestions
- [x] Task creation: auto/manual mode toggle with suggestion cards
- [x] Try-agent panel: debounced skill hint after 20+ chars
- [x] 38 backend tests, Playwright updated for mode toggle

### Streamlined Developer Journey (Mar 7) — ON STAGING (9/10 complete)
- [x] Backend: detect endpoint public (no auth, IP rate limited)
- [x] `/register-agent` page with 3-step flow (paste → review → register)
- [x] `RegisterAgentFlow` component with detect mutation, sign-in gate, pricing config
- [x] Frontend API: `detectAgent()` + `useDetectAgent()` hook
- [x] Dashboard welcome state for new users (replaces 6-step onboarding wizard)
- [x] Old onboarding deleted (route, wizard, all step components)
- [x] Landing page: two side-by-side CTAs ("Browse Agents" + "Register Your Agent")
- [x] Agent settings page at `/dashboard/agents/[id]` (edit, re-detect, deactivate, delete)
- [x] Agent detail page: "Manage Agent" button for owners
- [x] **E2E test for register-agent flow** (`frontend/e2e/register-agent.spec.ts`)

### Platform Bug Fixes (Mar 7) — ON STAGING, ALL VERIFIED
- [x] Bug #1: Duplicate agent registration → 409 (backend)
- [x] Bug #2: Auth hydration race — no "Sign In" flash (frontend)
- [x] Bug #3: API key auth sets cookie for middleware (frontend)
- [x] Bug #4: Semantic search wired to `POST /discover/` (frontend)
- [x] Bug #5: Onboarding completion on agent registration (frontend)

## In Progress / Remaining

### Immediate (this sprint)
- [x] Write E2E test for register-agent flow (detect → review → register → success)
- [x] Fix HF Space storage limit (>1GB, failing `upload_folder` deploys)
- [x] Agent activity tab / task logs per agent
- [ ] Merge staging → main (production deploy)

### Near-Term (Week 2+)
- [x] Analytics dashboard for agent owners
- [ ] Webhook logs viewer
- [ ] Version bumping UI (patch/minor/major)
- [ ] Magic box onboarding for end users (Approach B from simplified-onboarding-design)

### Backlog
- [ ] x402/OpenClaw payment integration (design: `2026-02-27-x402-openclaw-design.md`)
- [ ] Task lifecycle UX enhancement (design: `2026-03-05-task-lifecycle-ux-design.md`)
- [ ] Inline skill editor
- [ ] Agent verification system (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Multi-agent workflows / chaining

## Testing Mandate

**All changes MUST be tested backend AND frontend in parallel before marking complete.**
- Backend: direct API calls (httpx/curl) against staging
- Frontend: Playwright browser tests against staging UI
- Both must pass. No exceptions.
